Three points of discussion:
1. A student has pointed out some problems with the map I gave you:
- The map shows no path west from the Hallway back to the Receiving_room.
- The map shows no path north from the Healthclub_front to the Reception_area

Both of these were mistakes in the README file (similar to the earlier noted
mistake of the mislabelled (should be "w" not "d") edge from Maze4 to Maze2.

I'm just following the connections that I observed in the actual game.

I have provided you with a new file READMEnew, attached to this posting. It
has fixed all three of the above-mentioned mistakes (2 new and 1 old). These
changes can be seen by running:

% diff READMEnew README | head -16

2. A student also pointed out other missing edges from the map in the README
file. In this case, the map is actually correct (because it does not show loop-
back edges). The README file had discussed this topic in 2 places, but I have
added a third place, to make things clearer, as can be seen by running:

% diff READMEnew README | head -23 | tail -7
152,155c152
<    also provide you with a map of the connections (it is earlier in this README
<    file). Note that the map shows only the paths that lead to new places.
<    (Within the maze, some paths loop back on themselves. See lines 488-493 and
<    lines 274-295 for a discussion of which paths these are.)
---
>    also provide you with a map of the connections farther down in this file.


The above text fixes a mistatement about the map being below (when it was
actually above). The text also points you to the line numbers (in READMEnew)
where you can get more information about this topic.

3. I also fixed another typo that I spotted. (Of could -> Of course)
And I updated the discussion of the "cmd1 || ( cmd2 && cmd3 )" behavior. What
I mean is: an earlier posting about the homework had described this problem,
and the READMEnew file therefore has an updated-and-now correct discussion of
the "cmd1 || ( cmd2 && cmd3 )" behavior. These changes can be seen by running:

% diff READMEnew README | tail -12

<      direction. And, of course, if you type "nw" then you would go to Maze2,

<  cmd1 || ( cmd2 && cmd3 )  if cmd1 SUCCEEDS then cmd2 and cmd3 both SKIP.
