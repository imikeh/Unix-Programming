# Notice that the computer never makes a mistake. See also that the winning #
# row is indicated with "-" symbols.                                        #

# Now we'll do a series of runs where the computer goes first and always      #
# chooses the upper-right corner.                                             #
# To begin, in the following two games, the user's first move is to take      #
# the center. What you will want to notice is that the computer's second is   #
# different in these two runs: bottom-middle in the first run, but top-middle #
# in the secind run.                                                          #
# In other words, the same input (i.e., the same first two moves) has         #
# produced a different output (i.e., a different position for the computer's  #
# second move). And what this difference means is that the random aspect of   #
# the AI is working correctly. (Randomness is used only when more than one    #
# choice is equally good. In this case, both the top-middle and bottom-middle #
# were, indeed, equally good: each results in a tie, and no other move option #
# exists that would have guaranteed a win.                                    #
